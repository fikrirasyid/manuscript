# Parchment
### Activate then write. As easy as that.

> Insanely simple theme
> Activate, it looks good already
> With enough options to make it yours

## The Origin
Parchment is planned to be my fourth theme in repository. It is designed and developed in February 2015. I planned to submit at least six themes in 2015. This is my second theme in 2015.

## The Goals
Parchment is made with this goal in mind:

1. Looks great right from the start. No quirky setup needed.
2. Not bloating user with tons of options. It just works.
3. Enable user to customize things that matters: background (image or plain color), text & link color, selected typographic preference
4. Looks good in any size of screen

## Plugin Compatibilities

Parchment works nicely with these plugins:

1. [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/)’s Infinite Scroll & Site Logo
2. [Civil Footnotes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civil-footnotes/)
3. [Subtitles](https://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/)
